# 30 Days of Java learning series:

Welcome to my 30 Days of Java Learning Challenge!
This repository documents my daily progress, code snippets, exercises, and notes as I learn Java step by step.

**The goal:** Build a strong foundation in Java programming and share my journey with the community.

### Day 1: ✅
Today I have installed the `JDK` and setup the path in the Environment variables and setup my vs code for java compilation and code running. and my second learning is the code very basic codes and conversion of `.java` file to `.class` file (bytecode) which is used by the JVM to highly and securely compile the java file. <br>
The basic and my first program is about printing my name and understanding the meaning of words used in it. <br>

**1. public:** This means the file is accessible for every one. <br>
**2. static:** This means not to create a new object of the code we are writing. <br>
**3. void:** The return type of the function is void (or empty). <br>
**4. main:** Form here our code starts to run. <br>

After writing this we define a string in main funtionc like `(String[]arg)`. <br>

And by using the syntax `System.out.println()` we printed our desired output. 

### Day 2: ✅
Today I have learned about the variavbles, and different data types (like int,float,double,byte,char,string,etc,) and even learn how to decleatr them. I have also learn how to use octal,binary and hexadecimal no. in int data type. What are the ranges of the data types. What is hardcoded values. Created and find the area of various objects through hardcoded values in java

**Hardcoded values:** Values of variables which are defined inside the code and not been change by the user directly without entering into the actual code.

### Day 3: ✅
Today i have learned hoe to take input for the user usnig Scanner class in java. For doing this we need to import `java.util.Scanner` class because it contains all the type of scanner objects we use. Then create a new scanner object sc (or and other name) and type `System.in` meaning we are taking input thourgh the keyboard. Ther define that which type of input you are going to take like integer(nextInt()), double (nextDouble()), String(nextLine()),etc.
